___

## Solution Assessment ##

### Stage 1 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

___
#### Justification ##### 
Code runs the intended solution, the locking for the camera is statically in the center of the object. The little cross could be removed, but overall, everything looks good.
___
### Stage 2 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

___
#### Justification ##### 
Again, the code runs as intended, the object moves freely in some space within the autoscrolling segment. Good indication with the box for which the object can move in. 

___
### Stage 3 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

___
#### Justification ##### 
The code runs as intended, the camera follows the object, and if the object stops moving, the camera follows until the object is center. The camera could follow a bit more smoother, as it felt a little bit sudden, but overall, it works as inteded. 

___
### Stage 4 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

___
#### Justification ##### 
The code satisfies the objectives, however, the camera has a little delay in catching with the object and also moves rather suddenly, however it does capture the main objectives of the camera control. 

___
### Stage 5 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

___
#### Justification ##### 
The code satisfies the objectives, the camera again could use a little bit of work with the smoothness, but overall, it satisfies the objectives. The object can freely move in the inner box, and the camera only follows the object once the object leaves the inner box.
 
___
# Code Style #


### Description ###
Check the scripts to see if the student code adheres to the GDScript style guide.

If sections do not adhere to the style guide, please peramlink the line of code from Github and justify why the line of code has not followed the style guide.

It should look something like this:

* [description of infraction](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L) - this is the justification.

Please refer to the first code review template on how to do a permalink.


#### Style Guide Infractions ####
I couldn't find any infractions, the code looks well done, simple, and relatively easy to read. Only criticism is maybe for more comments describing the code. 

#### Style Guide Exemplars ####
[Everything was properly cased and placed.] (https://github.com/ensemble-ai/exercise-2-camera-control-zhxu33/blob/6a2c8c1422c8612aa7590b6a43bf896e5040c88b/Obscura/scripts/camera_controllers/controlled_camera1.gd#L25)
___
#### Put style guide infractures ####

___

# Best Practices #

### Description ###

If the student has followed best practices then feel free to point at these code segments as examplars. 

If the student has breached the best practices and has done something that should be noted, please add the infraction.


This should be similar to the Code Style justification.

#### Best Practices Infractions ####
Again, no infractions from what I could tell, everything seems be done correctly and well. 

#### Best Practices Exemplars ####
[All classes and functions are done properly.] (https://github.com/ensemble-ai/exercise-2-camera-control-zhxu33/blob/6a2c8c1422c8612aa7590b6a43bf896e5040c88b/Obscura/scripts/camera_controllers/controlled_camera1.gd#L24)
